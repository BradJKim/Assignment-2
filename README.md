Uploaded to GitHub: 11/18/23

Python Program that uses Newton's method, Secant method, Bisection method, or a hybrid method to find a root of a given linear function.
Flags implemented to specify method and to set max iterations and number of points required for method.
Input file holds linear function constants and output file holds root value, number of iterations, and success/fail response.
